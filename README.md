Save21
======
 What is it?
  -----------

  Save21 is a simple demonstration of an electronic coupon/rebate app running natively on the iOS 7.
  The idea of electronic coupon originates from existing apps such as Groupon and Checkout51. 
  It relieves the retailer from having to apply the discount at the cash register and enables the 
  product producers to quickly and easily deliver rebates to each customer through the app. The user 
  is able to view all participantsâ€™ latest offers, go out and buy the products on rebate, and send a 
  photo of the proof of purchase through Save21 to the company running the app. The company will verify 
  the validity of the proof, credit the user of the amount claimed, and sends the user a cheque once a 
  substantial amount of credit has been accumulated.


  This Demo
  ------------------
  This demo is fully functional feature-wise with mock offers. It freely lets any user to sign up for 
  an account, login to an existing account, and also reclaim a forgotten password through email. Their 
  user information is saved on a web back-end server. The list of offers including the top banners is 
  also fetched from my web server. Any uploaded photos from the user can be viewed or extracted from 
  my web server for manual verification. 

  Technical Details
  -------------
  The app demonstrates the requirements of a typical iOS app: a native iOS application built in xCode, 
  a web service API that feeds and fetches data from the app to web server, a back-end SQL database for
  storing flexible contents, and the use of a commercial Backend Service provider such as Parse for 
  managing secure user info.
  The web API is written in a RESTful manner using PHP and HTTP methods (e.g., GET, PUT, POST, or DELETE).

  Testing Environment
  ------------
  This demo is aimed at any iPhone with retina display, running on iOS 7+
  The project can be opened and compiled using xCode 5.
